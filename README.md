# ALittleMLProject
This is a Machine Learning project.

The code learns about housing prices based on house size, bathroom numbers and bedroom numbers with a data set.

The project is written in python.

Currently with our dataset the results have 33% error.
But with a crafted dataset (which is in the code) it gives almost 0% error.
So the algorithm work but the size, bedroom numbers and bathroom numbers are not a very good indicator of price.(Or our dataset is not good :) )

Note: I didn't create the data set
